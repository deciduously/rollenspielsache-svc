WIP - there's like nothing actually here yet.  This is more a guiding plan.

The Rollenspielsache is a set of tools for managing tabletop RPG games.  The goal is to handle the mechanics seamlessly, allowing you to participate or run a tabletop encounter without getting distracted by rule clarifications.

## Overview

This project defines the web service powering [`rollenspielsache-www`](https://github.com/deciduosuly/rollenspielsache-www) and probably other stuff in the future.

## Usage

`cargo run`.
